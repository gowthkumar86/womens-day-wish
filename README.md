# 🌸 Women's Day Wish Experience

A beautifully animated interactive celebration page created to make Women's Day special.

Each recipient receives a unique personalized link that opens a cinematic storytelling experience with games, messages, animations, and appreciation moments designed specifically for them.

Instead of sending a simple message, this project creates a memorable digital celebration.

# 💡 Why I Built This

Most Women's Day messages online are simple text wishes.

I wanted to build something more meaningful —
an interactive experience where people can celebrate someone
through storytelling, appreciation, and playful interaction.

This project focuses on combining emotional storytelling
with modern web animation to create a memorable digital celebration.
